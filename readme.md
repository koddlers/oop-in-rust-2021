# Object-oriented Programming in Rust 2021

by Giovanni Dicanio

Object-oriented Programming is a powerful and successful programming paradigm that helps create programs of all sizes
and complexity. This course will teach you in a practical way how to implement OOP concepts using Rust.

Modern computer programs can be very complex beasts, and to fight and conquer such complexity the Object-oriented
Programming paradigm was introduced. In this course, Object-oriented Programming in Rust, you’ll learn how to implement
OOP concepts using the Rust programming language. First, you’ll explore how to define your own objects in Rust using
structs and function implementation blocks. Then, you'll discover how to implement OOP concepts like encapsulation and
information hiding in Rust. Next, you’ll hear another important OOP concept, which is polymorphism, and you’ll learn how
to define objects that implement polymorphic behavior using traits and other features of the Rust programming language.
Finally, you’ll see a complete practical example of how to implement a common and important OOP design pattern in Rust:
the Observer design pattern. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of how to
structure and write Rust programs using Object-oriented Programming techniques.
